#' remss: A package for refining evaluation methodology on stage system.
#' 
#' TNM stage is important in treatment decision-making and outcome predicting. The existing oropharyngeal Cancer                
#' (OPC) TNM stages have not made distinction of the two sub sites of HPV+ and HPV- diseases.We developed novel              
#' criteria to assess performance of the TNM stage grouping schemes based on parametric modeling adjusting on                    
#' important clinical factors. These criteria evaluate the TNM stage grouping scheme in five different measures:                  
#' hazard  consistency, hazard discrimination, explained variation, likelihood difference, and balance.
